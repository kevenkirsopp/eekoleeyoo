¬∑ PDF XChange Viewer 2.5.191 . Without doubt the fastest, most feature rich alternative to Acrobat available - and unless you need really advanced features I currently use Adobe Reader to read academic papers on my iPad Pro. A lot of people recommend PDF Expert to handle PDFs. What features are offered by PDF Expert that Adobe Reader doesn‚Äôt. I need a PDF reader that will open a document on the page where you closed it. It also needs to be able to rotate to landscape mode. For bonus points, there should be an option to enable auto-rotation on the app regardless of whether it's enabled for the phone. Or just an option for permanent landscape mode. But these are secondary. 
When I zoom in, it just zooms in on the words. It doesn't actually change the size of the font so it all fits on my screen. I only need a viewer, not an editor. Hey guys, I'm looking for a PDF viewer (preferably a free/Open source/GNU one) that lets the user highlight text in a PDF and then display these annotations and their text (this is the important part) in a list. The problem with programs like Adobe Reader or Drawboard (besides the proprietary licence) is although they allow you to highlight and view annotations, to my knowledge they just show things like the time the annotation was made, the author, the highlight colour etc. I am looking I'm just getting back into playing after a 15 year break. Obviously since I last played, technology has come a long way! Before I start buying books, are there any websites / apps you can recommend for getting free / buying sheet music? If I could use my iPad, I would prefer that to tons of books so PDF sheet music or specific apps I can purchase through would be good. 8notes looks like it has a decent selection. I would possibly be willing to subscribe to get access to the transposed version. Over the years I've found small programs that I now find invaluable. They usually do only one thing but do it well. I use them everyday at work and at home and just wanted to share. These are all free and for Windows. Everything ( - extremely versatile and fast file indexer/search. It does not index file contents, only names and paths. I even use it as a launcher since it takes more time to browse the windows start button. Contrary to what you might think What are my options here? Acrobat has lots of features, but is thought to be unsecure. Ditto for Foxit, not as good as it was before apparently. Sumatra would be absolutely perfect, but it doesn't let me highlight. What else is left? I've heard good things about Nitro PDF/PDF X-Change, but how secure/fast are they? Or will using EMET in tandem with them be enough to secure myself against exploits? edit: to be clear, yes I am asking for suggestions. For months I've been trying to find a PDF reader that is as fast and full of features as GoodReader for iOS. I use GoodReader on my iPad Air 1, and my phone is a Galaxy Note 4 (which theoretically has better hardware than my iPad), and I still haven't been able to find a reader that is as fast. What I have tried so far: Adobe Reader Foxit Reader (the least slow one) MuPDF Moon+ Reader Pro APV PDF Viewer ezPDF Reader Radaee PDF Reader All of them are either slow when changing pages 
Due to some changes in adobes pdf software that I haven't liked, I have began looking for some alternatives. I figured asking here might get me some solid software. Do you guys use any non-adobe pdf viewers for reading papers. It appears a lot of blocks when I try to select a text. Whenever I try to search a word, nothing happens. Is there anything I can do to transform this to editable text and stuff? http://www.cbm.rs.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RTCBMRS-n.%C2%BA-05-Parte-03-2016.pdf. I need some way to convert office documents (mainly Excel and Word) to PDF but I do not want to use Adobe Acrobat pro. Also alternative for Acrobat Reader is welcome for previewing.
